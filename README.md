## Setup/Installation Requirements



* _1. Clone this repo._
* _X. _dotnet add package MySqlConnector -v 2.2.0_
* _8. _create the file appsettings.json, and what code to include in it. We recommend using the above formatting and directing users to replace [YOUR-USERNAME-HERE] and [YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE] with the user's own user and password values. also add [YOUR-DB-NAME] with database used_
* _this format -> 
<!-- {
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR-DB-NAME];uid=[YOUR-USER-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
} -->
* _2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ProjectFile"._
* _3. In the command line, run the command `\$ dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal._
* _4. Optionally, you can run `\$ dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it._
* _5. Use `\$ dotnet test run` in the Test directory to run test on the application_
* _6. use `\$ dotnet watch run` to cycle the server_
* _7. use `\$ dotnet watch run --launch-profile "production"` to run in production mode_
