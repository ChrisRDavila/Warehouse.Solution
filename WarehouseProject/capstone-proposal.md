## Capstone Proposal

## Name of Student:
# Chrisopher Davila

## Name of Project:
# Warehouse Project Solution

## Projects Purpose:
# This is A C# MVC framework project for a real company to set up a inventory system to catalogue and track product movement and staging in various warehouses

## MVP
# Product will allow consumer to create pick sheets to locate products for fullfillment, give a list of available products at current wherehouse and a list of products staged at other warehouses to fullfill orders. User should be able to log in securely create aithentic List based on User profile that can only be used by said User.  

## Technologies, framework, libraries used for MVP

* _dot net 6_
* _cshtml_
* _C#_
* _ASP Core MVC_
* _MS Build_
* _MS identity Core_
* _MySQL_


## Spread Goals
# I hope to also create a sales dept that directly changes inventory with sales instead of updating product. I would also like to connect to an Currency/Crypto exchane API to calculate costs based on international denominations and current rates of crypto currency. Site should be hosted by Azure, have multiple step authentication.  Would also like to connect it to Carrier API to schedule delivery or recieve shipments. Should be able to scan products into warehouse inventory based on Bar code, or update inventory with FTP, schedule auto updates to invetory relating to FTP.

## Additinal Tech needed for spead goals
* _Azure_
* _USPS Web Tolls API_
* _Currency Exchange and Forex API_

## Additional Notes
# stretch goals may require new tech upon research, investigating the possiblilty of using JQuery or other libraries to aid in identity set up and UI, as well as authentication. May change name of Repo bsaed on disgression of client i will be building App for, will discuss with client over the weekend (after 7-7-23)
